\f0\fs24 \cf0 Part 1\
Name: Mastah Mind\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 The classic game of Master Mind brought to life as a Meggy Jr version in which a player can enjoy all the fun of the game anywhere they please to. Mastah Mind is an intellectual game that requires a player to use deductive reasoning to solve a color based problem. A player will have eight guesses to find out four colors and the order that they have been placed in. Each time a player figures out the secret code they will earn a point, failing to solve the puzzle will count against them subtracting one point from their score. Obtaining a score of eight will result in the player obtaining the ultimate victory and the coveted title of 'Master Mind'. \

Part 2\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 The intro to comp science final project was by far the hardest project that I was given this semester and one that deserves an explanation as to the final result. First off let me go by saying that this project probably taught me more about how to live a solid life than it did about programming with the language C. My project was already one that was quite difficult and something that I proposed off of a whim. Originally I didn't think that the project was going to be that hard since we already had classes teaching us about the Meggy and the parameters we had to work in, boy was I wrong. I would say that 90% of my project was just doing research and trying to understand programming. I put in a good 12 hours reading over example code from a library and comparing the code that others had written. It was technically lucky that I found a code in the evil scientist library that was pretty much master mind. Sadly I ended up turning in a majority of my final project that was directly cited from the code. Although I understood and could clearly comment on exactly what was happening in the code I found it extremely hard to write my own code. By the end of the break I had put in over 20 hours but was having almost no success in writing my own code. But it was by no means what I considered a failure. I know that you, Mr.Kiang, said that you could only grade on the code that I wrote. In the end I only wrote code on the directional movement, scoring system and winning screen. Though what I truly gained from the project was an understanding of how technical skills work. No matter how much you read or study others code unless you have on the job experience and a steady hand to guide you its impossible to achieve true success. \
It was from studying code that I learned a lot about the basis of the programming, now I can read almost everyone's code in the class and tell what its doing. Though it was from my time working with others in the class, conferencing with the teacher and having screen hero time together in which I learned how to write code. I was too conceited in my past experiences where I could do things by myself that I was blind to the help of those around. Only at the end, when I was out of time that I asked for help, and gained the most knowledge on programming the code myself. Programming requires you to not only read the code but also to have work time to grasp it. I haven't been able to show all I learned in my code itself but I have put in the time and know that I have gained the knowledge that others have on programming. \
\uc0\u8232 When it comes to the technical of the game I would have to say that the only bugs that I have has to do with the game restarting and the controls. For one, after the win screen comes up the game does not reset back to the score of one and kind of crashes. I think that the problem lies in the placement of the "else" command. I haven't been able to find out where it goes but I believe with proper placement in the void loop I will be able to fix the problem and have the game reset. The directional control code that I wrote also has a few glitches so I ended up just tweaking the games directional code so that it could work with the new scoring system I implemented. I think that the directional controls are being messed up by the addition of a for loop that helps composite the guessCode in the void loop. The guessCode sets restrictions on the spacing of the dots and what areas are reserved for the computer's response to the player's guess. This interaction is what I believe is causing the directional controls to bug out when the game resets. \
If I had more time to work on this project I would first attempt to head to a teacher or friend to get their opinion. The few times that I did work with others I was able to advance quite a bit or at least trouble shoot my errors. I know that I didn't technically code a lot of this game and a lot of my work was altering the basis of the code I found, and cited, online. I would definitely try to make the game even closer to my own work by reforming the idea of the game. It wasn't until too late that I realized that if I changed my games concept I could write my own code. Once I saw the code for mastermind it was over. I couldn't get erase what I had saw in the code. I was locked into a mindset where I couldn't produce my own originally code for the guessing function and ended up leaving it as it was. By changing the basis of the game I feel as though I could start anew and program exactly how I wanted to instead of being confined to the idea.\
\uc0\u8232 Most of all I think that my biggest issue was time management. Its not that I didn't set aside enough time but rather that I focused on certain issues too much. I was too afraid and shy to go to others for help when I had the time which left me with a little period at the end to rush and try to fix things. I know that I didn't do things as extravagant as others or have their originality but I have learned valuable lessons for future and understand the process of reading code. I hope that there is enough of this project to grade and that I cited all of my code correctly. I commented maybe more than I programmed but this was mainly so that I could try to paint a picture for myself and for others on what was going on. I hope this code and these lessons can be used by the next classes students as a guideline for the possibilities they have and the mistakes they should avoid. \
